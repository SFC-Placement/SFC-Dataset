### Optimized Placement of Service Function Chains in Edge Cloud Systems Using LSTM
Edge computing has transformed the landscape of network service delivery by significantly reducing latency and increasing efficiency. This paradigm brings computing and data storage closer to the data source, resulting in speedier and more reliable services. Edge computing enhances network performance by reducing the distance data must travel, resulting in faster reaction times and more reliable connectivity, which is critical for applications that demand real-time processing and low latency. In this context, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Function Chaining (SFC) play pivotal roles. Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) are software-based network services or functions that run on virtualized infrastructure, such as virtual machines (VMs) or containers, rather than specific hardware appliances. These VNFs provide flexibility and scalability, adjusting to changing client demands by using elastic virtual resources rather than static, rigid physical models. SFC efficiently coordinates and regulates the flow of network traffic through a sequence of specified service functions, ensuring that each packet passes through a preset set of processing stages. 
Existing network orchestration methods often rely on static, hardware-dependent models that lack flexibility and adaptability, leading to inefficiencies and higher costs. Additionally, the default KubeEdge scheduler employs a round-robin mechanism for node selection, which can lead to suboptimal performance if nodes become overloaded. To address these limitations, predictive models are used for proactive placement of SFC's. Predictive capacity enables the system to proactively manage resources, ensuring that traffic is dynamically sent to the most appropriate nodes, hence avoiding overload and under utilization. This method not only increases resource usage and application performance, but it also simplifies network administration, making it an effective strategy for edge computing and containerized applications.In this work, we use LSTM and ILP models to improve resource management and optimize SFC placement. LSTM models are recurrent neural network (RNN) that excel at predicting time series data because they can recall prior inputs. In our scenario, LSTM models assess node utilization data to determine which nodes are underused. Before identifying underutilized nodes with the LSTM model, Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is used to improve the placement of service functions. ILP is a mathematical optimization approach that seeks the optimal answer among a set of feasible solutions under specific restrictions. By taking into account variables such as CPU utilization, Memory usage, Bandwidth Consumption, delay and each VNF's individual requirements, the ILP model guarantees that service functions are deployed in a way that maximizes resource efficiency while minimizing delay and needless processing. We implemented a KubeEdge cluster with one master node and eight edge nodes.
